# 🏥 Multi_Diseases_Analysis

This project is a web-based application built with Flask that utilizes pre-trained machine learning models to predict the risk of various diseases based on user-provided health data. The system offers an intuitive interface for users to get quick predictions for Heart Disease, Brain Stroke, Lung Disease, and Kidney Disease.

# ✨ Features

- **Heart Disease Prediction**: A model to assess the risk of heart disease. ❤️

- **Brain Stroke Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of a brain stroke. 🧠

- **Lung Disease Prediction**: Determines the risk of developing a lung-related condition. 🫁

- **Kidney Disease Prediction**: Analyzes data to detect the presence of chronic kidney disease. 🫘

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and clean web interface for data input and result display.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 🐍

- **Web Framework**: Flask 🧪

- **Machine Learning**: joblib for model loading 📦

- **Frontend**: HTML, Tailwind CSS (for styling)

# 💡 Future Improvements

- Add more diseases for prediction

- Enhance recommendation system with diet & fitness APIs
